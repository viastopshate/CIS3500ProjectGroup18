# Chromagotchi Landing Page (Version 1.0)

Welcome to the Chromagotchi Landing Page! This page serves as a fun and interactive way to track your browsing habits and encourage productivity. With Chromagotchi, you can visualize your online activity and take care of a virtual pet at the same time.

## How It Works

The landing page displays a list of websites you've visited, categorized as either "On Task" or "Off Task." You can easily add new websites using the provided input field, and the page will automatically track the time you opened each website.

As you browse the web, your actions affect the health of your virtual pet, the Chromagotchi. Opening new websites will decrease the Chromagotchi's health, while closing websites will increase it. The goal is to strike a balance between productivity and leisure to keep your Chromagotchi happy and healthy.

## Components
