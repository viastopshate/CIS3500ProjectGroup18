## Components

### Landing Page (1.0)

The Landing Page (Version 1.0) supports the following features:

1. **Website Categorization:** Users can categorize websites as either "On Task" or "Off Task" based on their productivity value. The landing page allows users to easily move websites between these two categories, providing a clear overview of their browsing activity.
2. **Tamagotchi Health System:** The landing page integrates a virtual pet, the Chromagotchi, whose health is directly influenced by the user's browsing behavior. Opening new websites decreases the Chromagotchi's health, while closing websites increases it. This gamification element encourages users to be mindful of their internet usage and strike a balance between productivity and leisure.
3. **Real-time Website Addition:** Users can add new websites to the landing page in real-time using the provided input field. Upon adding a website, it is automatically reflected in the appropriate task category ("On Task" or "Off Task") and immediately affects the Chromagotchi's health based on the total number of websites opened.
